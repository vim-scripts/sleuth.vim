This plugin automatically adjusts 'shiftwidth' and 'expandtab' heuristically based on the current file, or, in the case the current file is new, blank, or otherwise insufficient, by looking at other files of the same type in the current and parent directories.  In lieu of adjusting 'softtabstop', 'smarttab' is enabled.

Compare to DetectIndent (vimscript #1171).  I wrote this because I wanted something fully automatic.  My goal is that by installing this plugin, you can remove all indenting related configuration from your vimrc.
